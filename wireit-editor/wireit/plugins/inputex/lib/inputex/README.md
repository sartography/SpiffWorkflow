InputEx
=======

[inputEx](http://neyric.github.com/inputex) is an open-source javascript framework to build fields and forms for web applications using the YUI library.

All the fields and forms are configured using JSON or created in Javascript. It provides a very efficient abstraction for building interactive web applications.

Disclaimer: It doesn't use existing html yet. (it is not an unobtrusive library yet)

For detailed informations, have a look at our complete documentation.

It is built on top of the [YUI library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) (2.8.0r4) and supports all major browsers. Please report your specific browser issues in the forum.
