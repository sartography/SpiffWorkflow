When an error occurs with a Task Specification (maybe should have been called
a SpecException)

SpiffWorkflowException

**Attributes/Methods**

- **sender**:  The TaskSpec - the specific Task, Gateway, etc... that caused the error to happen.
- **error**:  a human readable error message describing the problem.
- **get_task_trace**:  Provided a specific Task, will work it's way through the workflow / sub-processes
and call activities to show where an error occurred.  Useful if the error happened within a deeply nested structure (where call activities include call activities ....)

WorkflowDataException
------------------
When an exception occurs moving data between tasks and Data Objects (including
data inputs and data outputs.)

**Extends**
WorkflowException

**Attributes/Methods**

(in addition to the values in a WorkflowException)

 - **task**:  The specific task (not the task spec, but the actual executing task)
 - **data_input**: The spec of the input variable
 - **data_output**: The spec of the output variable

WorkflowTaskException
--------
**Extends**
WorkflowException

**Attributes/Methods**

(in addition to the values in a WorkflowException)

 - **task**:  The specific task (not the task spec, but the actual executing task)
 - **error_msg**: The detailed human readable message.  (conflicts with error above)
 - **exception**: The original exception this wraps around.
 - **line_number** The line number that contains the error
 - **offset** The point in the line that caused the error
 - **error_line** The content of the line that caused the error.

It will accept the line_number and error_line as arguments - if the
underlying error provided is a SyntaxError it will try to derive this
information from the error.
If this is a name error, it will attempt to calculate a did-you-mean
error_msg.

Unused / Deprecated errors
--------------------

** StorageException **
Deprecated -- Used only by the PrettyXmlSerializer - which is not under active
support.

** DeadMethodCalled **
