What is SpiffWorkflow?
======================

SpiffWorkflow is a library that provides a flexible workflow execution environment.

Recent development has largely focused on allowing Python applications to process
BPMN diagrams.

SpiffWorkflow allows your python application to process BPMN diagrams (think
of them as very powerful flow charts,  See :doc:`bpmn/intro`.) to accomplish
what would otherwise require writing a lot of complex business logic in your
code. You can use these diagrams to accomplish a number of tasks, such as:

 - Creating a questionnaire with multiple complex paths
 - Implement an approval process that requires input from multiple users
 - Allow non-programmers to modify the flow and behavior of your application.

related projects including SpiffArena, Service Connectors, and BPMN.js
extensions.
