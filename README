Spiff Workflow
---------------
This library is part of the Spiff platform.

Spiff Workflow is a library implementing a framework for workflows.
It is based on http://www.workflowpatterns.com and implemented in pure Python.

API documentation is embedded into the Spiff Workflow source code and
currently not yet available elsewhere. Other developer documentation has not
yet been written.

If you need more help, please drop by our mailing list. You might actually
make someone write the missing pieces of documentation.
