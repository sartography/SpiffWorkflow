Spiff Workflow is a library implementing workflows in pure Python.
It was designed to provide a clean API, and tries to be very easy to use.

You can find a list of supported workflow patterns in the `README file`_
included with the package.

WARNING! This software is still under development - there are no guarantees
to API stability at this time.
