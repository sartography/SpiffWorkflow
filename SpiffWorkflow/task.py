    The following states may exist:

    - FUTURE: The task will definitely be reached in the future,
      regardless of which choices the user makes within the workflow.

    - LIKELY: The task may or may not be reached in the future. It
      is likely because the specification lists it as the default
      option for the ExclusiveChoice.

    - MAYBE: The task may or may not be reached in the future. It
      is not LIKELY, because the specification does not list it as the
      default choice for the ExclusiveChoice.

    - WAITING: The task is still waiting for an event before it
      completes. For example, a Join task will be WAITING until all
      predecessors are completed.

    - READY: The conditions for completing the task are now satisfied.
      Usually this means that all predecessors have completed and the
      task may now be completed using
      :class:`Workflow.complete_task_from_id()`.

    - CANCELLED: The task was cancelled by a CancelTask or
      CancelWorkflow task.

    - COMPLETED: The task was regularily completed.

    Note that the LIKELY and MAYBE tasks are merely predicted/guessed, so
    those tasks may be removed from the tree at runtime later. They are
    created to allow for visualizing the workflow at a time where
    the required decisions have not yet been made.
