class Join(TaskSpec):
    """
    A task for synchronizing branches that were previously split using a
    conditional task, such as MultiChoice. It has two or more incoming
    branches and one or more outputs.

    Keep in mind that each Join spec may have multiple corresponding
    Task objects::

        - When using the MultiInstance task
        - When using the ThreadSplit task

    When using the MultiInstance pattern, Join works across all
    the resulting task instances. When using the ThreadSplit
    pattern, Join ignores instances from another thread.

    A Join task may enter the following states::

        - FUTURE, LIKELY, or MAYBE: These are the initial predicted states.

        - WAITING: This state is reached as soon as at least one of the
        predecessors has completed.

        - READY: All predecessors have completed. If multiple tasks within
        the thread reference the same Join (e.g. if MultiInstance is used),
        this state is only reached on one of the tasks; all other tasks go
        directly from WAITING to completed.

        - COMPLETED: All predecessors have completed, and
        L{Task.complete()} was called.

    The state may also change directly from WAITING to COMPLETED if the
    Trigger pattern is used.
