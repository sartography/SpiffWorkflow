class TaskSpec(object):

    """
    This class implements an abstract base type for all tasks.

    Tasks provide the following signals:
      - **entered**: called when the state changes to READY or WAITING, at a
        time where spec data is not yet initialized.
      - **reached**: called when the state changes to READY or WAITING, at a
        time where spec data is already initialized using data_assign
        and pre-assign.
      - **ready**: called when the state changes to READY, at a time where
        spec data is already initialized using data_assign and
        pre-assign.
      - **completed**: called when the state changes to COMPLETED, at a time
        before the post-assign variables are assigned.
      - **cancelled**: called when the state changes to CANCELLED, at a time
        before the post-assign variables are assigned.
      - **finished**: called when the state changes to COMPLETED or CANCELLED,
        at the last possible time after the post-assign variables are
        assigned and mutexes are released.

    Event sequence is: entered -> reached -> ready -> completed -> finished
        (cancelled may happen at any time)

    The only events where implementing something other than state tracking
    may be useful are the following:_
      - Reached: You could mess with the pre-assign variables here, for
        example. Other then that, there is probably no need in a real
        application.
      - Ready: This is where a task could implement custom code, for example
        for triggering an external system. This is also the only event where a
        return value has a meaning (returning non-True will mean that the
        post-assign procedure is skipped.)

        Constructor.

        The difference between the assignment of a data value using
        the data argument versus pre_assign and post_assign is that
        changes made using data are task-local, i.e. they are
        not visible to other tasks.
        Similarly, "defines" are spec data fields that, once defined, can
        no longer be modified.
